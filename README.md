# Guts
Guts is a seed starter for working with WordPress (WP). In just a few short commands you have a local setup with a working version of WP contained in it's own directory, with the /wp-content/ directory on the same level as WP.

## Get Started
1. Clone Guts to your local working directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt setup`
4. Run `grunt watcher`
5. Go to work
