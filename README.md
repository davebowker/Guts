# Guts
Guts is a seed starter for working with WordPress (WP). In just a few short commands you have a local setup with a working version of WP contained in it's own directory, with the /wp-content/ directory on the same level as WP.

## Get Started

1. Create a new project directory and `cd` into it

	`mkdir projectName`
	
	`cd projectName`
	
2. Clone Guts to your project directory

	`git clone https://github.com/davebowker/Guts.git . --recursive`
	
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `grunt setup`
5. Run `grunt watcher`
6. Go to work
